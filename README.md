This is a final project for the University of Washington CSE ME455 course, "Computer Vision". Participants:
Shaheryar Hasnain, Ivan Stepanov, Digjay Das.

The topic of this project is Stereo Depth perception using a mobile camera(s). Two android phones with similar
main lenses are used. The general goals are:

1. Find the depth of an image, using two photos of the same objects and space but from different angles. 
2. Use this algorithm to create real-time depth perception, using a live feed from the cameras or a 2 videos.
3. Compare the results with pre-trained Neural Network models.

The first step involves a multitude of subtasks to solve, for example, calibration of the cameras is needed, in order to obtain disparity, from which the depth of the image can be found.
